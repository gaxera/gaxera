# Gaxera

> What would an operating system look like if we designed it today
> — from nothing — knowing everything we know now?

Not a fork. Not a distribution. Not another layer on Linux.
A ground-up answer.

## Why Start Over

Every major operating system carries decades of compromises made for
a world that no longer exists. Security bolted on after the fact. File
systems that store bytes but lose every shred of context. AI treated
as a product feature instead of a fundamental reality. Privacy as a
settings toggle instead of a structural guarantee.

These aren't bugs. They're consequences of building on foundations
that were never designed for what computing became.

Gaxera starts from a different premise: keep the lessons. Drop the
constraints. Design what should exist, not what's easiest to patch.

## What Comes Out Different

**Security is the kernel, not a layer on it.** Every resource requires
an unforgeable capability token. No token, no access. No root. No
sudo. No ambient authority. This is how the kernel itself works — not
something wrapped around it.

**AI is infrastructure you control.** Not a chatbot in a sidebar. Not
a feature you subscribe to. Intelligence embedded across the system —
resource management, workflow understanding, system adaptation. You
wield it. It doesn't wield you.

**Knowledge, not just files.** Traditional file systems are glorified
containers — they hold bytes and forget everything else. Why a
decision was made, how components relate, the history of a project's
evolution — all of it lost the moment you hit save. Gaxera's data
model preserves context: reasoning, relationships, and lineage travel
with the data. The system understands what it holds, not just where
it's stored.

**Compatibility without compromise.** Gaxera is designed as if Windows,
Linux, and macOS never existed. Then it builds translation layers that
run existing software on its own terms. Legacy shapes the compatibility
layer — never the architecture.

**Privacy by structure.** Zero telemetry isn't a toggle in settings.
It's a property of the architecture itself. The pathways for data to
leak simply don't exist, because they were never built.

## Status

🚧 **v0.1 — early development.**

Right now I'm building the foundation: a Rust microkernel that boots
on bare metal, manages memory, handles interrupts, and proves every
step before moving to the next. The architecture above it exists as
[design and specification](docs/spec/technical_spec.md) — not code.
Yet.

[Here's where things stand.](docs/roadmap/roadmap_v01.md)

## How This Started

This project didn't begin with code. It began with seven design
sessions — pulling apart what operating systems are, why they work
the way they do, and what they'd look like if we weren't carrying
their history.

Every decision, every rejected idea, every argument is documented
and public.

## Building

The project is currently in the foundational documentation and governance phase. Code scaffolding and build instructions will be published when Phase 1 implementation begins.

## Contributing

I'm the only one building this right now.
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to change that.

Architectural decisions go through a formal
[ADR process](docs/adr/0000-engineering-philosophy.md). I'd rather
be slow and right than fast and lost.
